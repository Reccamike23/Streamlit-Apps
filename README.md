The iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning
that contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three
different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each flower
is described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal
length, and petal width. The dataset is commonly used as a
benchmark for machine learning algorithms.
